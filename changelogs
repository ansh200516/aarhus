This file contains the significant code changes to the cachesaver library that should be documented for the future

1. Prompt changes in HotPotQA (Ansh)
2. Created class "StateReturningAgent" to indicate whether an agent returns actions or states
3. Created "wrap_class_in_env" method: this wraps the "Agent" classes in a "StateReturningAgent" using the current env
4. Diff bw het_foa and foa: het_foa works with states, not actions. ie, het_foa expects all of its agents to be derived from class "StateReturningAgents". It expects that agent.act(...) -> List[GameState].
2. Changes in game states (needs to be done for all games):
    1. Add "reflections: List[str]" to store relections in each state
    2.
