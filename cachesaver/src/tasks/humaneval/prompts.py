If `n` is 3, the loop runs once (for `_ = 2`), `b` becomes `0+1=1` (still the 1st Fibonacci), which is incorrect for F(3). To compute the Nth Fibonacci number, the loop should effectively run `n-1` times after establishing F(0) and F(1). A common fix is to loop `for _ in 2..=n` or adjust the initial values/return value. For instance, returning `a` if `n=0` and `b` otherwise after the loop `for _ in 0..n-1 { ... }` (with `a=0, b=1` initially for n>0) or ensuring the loop iterates correctly to compute up to the Nth term. <solution> Loop `for _ in 2..=n` or adjust the initial values/return value.
