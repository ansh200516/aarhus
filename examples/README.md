## Examples

The `async_openai_wrapper` shows how to use OpenAI models with cachesaver. This also illustrates the main features:
 - caching across runs
 - reusing samples based on the concept of namespaces
 - async batching, request deduplication

The `foa/` directory is work-in-progress and contains snippets of code related to an ongoing research project. We're close to open-sourcing that project, but for now please don't disseminate anything under `foa/`.
